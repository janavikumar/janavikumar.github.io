        <section class="content">
            <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">O</b>n a sunny autumn afternoon, Rucker Park is filled with fashion photographers, basketball players, and two hunched, graying men in golf caps who sit away from the rest of the park-goers, intermittently hocking loogies.</p>
            <p>Bordering the Harlem and Washington Heights neighborhoods, the park is tucked neatly beneath the Macombs-Dam Bridge that connects Manhattan to the Bronx. A New York cornerstone, the park is home to what is considered the most famous streetball court in America. On September 24th, Representative Adriano Espaillat announced that the House had passed H.R.6852, a bill that he introduced to get the legendary park federally enshrined as a National Commemorative Site. </p>
            <p>Commemoration is more than warranted. For a few weeks every summer, Rucker Park becomes a small center of the basketball world. The park’s famed tournaments attract everyone from politicians to rappers to NBA players; stars from Kobe Bryant to Earl Manigault have taken on the crowd in years past. The rich and famous, accustomed to courtside seats in Madison Square Garden, are patted down by security guards and crammed side-by-side with hundreds of New Yorkers in the bleachers. </p>
            <p>Today, months after the tournaments have ended, the court is back to being the center of a neighborhood park. Still, the energy and people of the court persist. Most people arrive separately but then easily fall into a rhythm, all knowing their part in an elaborate dance of sharing space. Pick-up games are wordlessly assembled, joints are shared between strangers, and players avoid the half court circle where a girl in a matching two-piece set poses for photographers with a bottle of Espolòn in-between her feet. </p>
            <p>“Hi, nephew!” a middle-aged woman calls out from behind the fence, and a player drops the ball to enthusiastically wave back to her. The two-on-three game he is in has become steadily more raucous and sweaty. His teammate smacks him on the head for his lapse before turning around and repeating, sincerely, “Hi, auntie.” The players are imposing, and their tangled chorus of voices is at once crass and supportive:  “Go through, go through!” “Left, left, I’m here!” “See when you’re a fatass…!” “Nice one!”</p>
            <p>On the side opposite the two-on-three game where no one watches or yells is a little boy, just done with his day at a nearby grade school. For several minutes, he runs to and from the three-point line, threading the ball between his legs mid-air before bouncing it off the backboard. He lifts his head only to turn and watch the melee of larger bodies on the other side of the court. After a few minutes, he walks over to them, bouncing his own ball until he is noticed. His head, still bowed, is level with the other players’ waists.</p>
            <p>“You wanna play, little man?” The boy nods. Ten minutes later, the boy still has barely spoken, but one of his opponents has seen enough. The team the boy joined, partially because of his shiftiness, partially because their opponents can’t mow him over, had rapidly gained traction. </p>
            <p>“Shit,” the man laughs, looking over at the bleachers, “we’re getting cooked.”</p>

            <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">F</b>all days at Rucker Park see many games like this, locals with baby teeth and those with years of basketball training alike shooting hoops before the New York cold settles in. </p>
            <p>One of the men in flat caps recalls the history of the courts and the different legends the floor has seen, rattling off names. “Wilt one day, little cousin here the next,” he jokes. He bellows encouragement to the boy, who misses. </p>
            <p>Not everyone can be Wilt Chamberlain, but Rucker Park continues to be a training ground for the streetballer. Its namesake, playground director Holcombe Rucker, designed it so. In 1950, Rucker began a basketball tournament in an effort to urge neighborhood kids to stay off the street and onto a path to college. Rucker Tournament eclipsed itself, quickly morphing into a community event where players showed off, dunking and crossover dribbling. There was a swagger to the play that the professional leagues of the fifties and sixties would have seriously frowned upon. But the NBA today looks more like old school Rucker Park.
            </p>
            <p>Sports journalist Scoop Jackson maintains that Holcombe Rucker’s impact on the game of basketball deserves more than just federal enshrinement for his park. “All of these city All-Star games, all of the NBA summer leagues you see everywhere…all this started with Mr. Rucker. He was the one who started all that! He single-handedly turned the game of basketball into a year long sport.”
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, as more passersby don sweat pants and puffy jackets over the next few weeks, Rucker Park still draws a crowd from near and far.
            </p>
            <p>“It’s very famous, even in Japan,” Toma, a 22-year-old medical student from Kyoto, says, wiping his brow. Toma grew up playing basketball, and Rucker Park made it to his New York City solo trip itinerary, along with a Knicks game at MSG and a trip to Times Square.
            </p>
            <p>Kam, a 23-year-old designer who embodies Rucker Park’s competitive-meets-compassionate energy, lies down on the bleachers after playing with Toma on a crisp October day. Kam doesn't frequent the park too often during his visits home, but says it was an escape from all the noise during his childhood and an outlet. “I feel like when you’re out here, you try to make a quick statement for yourself, you feel me? If I’m playing anything, anywhere, ever, I don’t ever want to lose. I gotta do my shimmy, do my move, get my spot. It’s not that deep but it is at the same time,” he laughs. 
            </p>
            <p>Whether a simple childhood escape or summertime mecca, Rucker Park belongs to its neighborhood. Keeping it this way is proving increasingly challenging. Poverty is high in the neighborhoods around the park and over two decades worth of gentrification have not helped.  
            </p>
            <p>Jackson notes that Holcombe Rucker’s name is often followed up with mention of the scholarships he provided for local players. But he is quick to challenge the notion that scholarships or even the stars of Rucker Park should be the sole focus. “What about the kids who don’t get scholarships? It’s the joy, it’s the freedom, it’s what [the park] has done to the game of basketball. When kids walk out of their tenements and look at Rucker Park they know what it means to have something like that in their neighborhood.” 
            </p>
            <p>Espailla’s bill calls for Congress to designate Rucker Park as a National Commemorative site, which would help protect the court’s culture, legacy, and future. The bill awaits a Senate vote and presidential signature before Rucker Park can join the ranks of other Commemorative Sites like Charleston School District, the first fully-integrated school district in the former Confederate States, the Kennedy-King Memorial, and the Quindaro Townsite, a post-Civil War settlement for the formerly enslaved. Unlike its counterparts, however, Rucker Park would not become a unit of the National Park System. Instead, the bill forms an agreement between the Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, and the State of New York to protect the park from being effectively seized by private property managements or high-density public housing ordinances. 
            </p>
            <p>Protections would come right on time. Earlier this year, tenants living in public housing just two blocks from the park appealed a class action lawsuit they filed in 2022 against HUD, New York City Housing Authority, and a private management company that took over the projects.  Many public housing residents find themselves having to negotiate with private housing companies instead of the city after 2020, when New York City invoked the federal program RAD in the hopes to lift NYCHA out of a funding hole. The Obama-era policy enabled almost 9% of NYCHA apartments to be potentially shifted to private management ownership. 
            </p>
            <p>As of now, Holcombe Rucker Park sits nestled up against the Harlem River and a large public housing block. The park consists of a public restroom, a field, a tennis wall, and a playground where children run around chasing each other around a swing set and a large, climbable whale. There is also, of course, the basketball court. 
            </p>
            <p>In the face of private corporate interests and increasing house prices, the enshrinement of Rucker Park has some urgency. Given the park’s historical and cultural contribution to both New York City and the sport of basketball, the plaque that would accompany enshrinement is long overdue in a symbolic gesture to the community as well. 
            </p>
            <p>“It’s meaningful for sure,” Kam says, “especially for the people who grew up here…it’s all important. But how can we know it’ll be protected? It’ll never be the people’s as much as we want it to be…making these things signifies us in a national monument, but if the places around us change, and they will, the people who built it won’t be around no more, you feel me?” 
            </p>

            <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">B</b>ack on the basketball court, the little boy’s thin chest rises and falls rapidly under his baggy sweatshirt.  His play has worsened.  Another player calls for a break. They sit on the bleachers, panting, checking phones, making small talk.
            </p>
            <p>And what brings the little boy, our future Wilt Chamberlain, to the courts today?
            </p>
            <p>“It’s Monday,” he explains.
            </p>
            <p>When play resumes, the boy has relaxed some.  His smile is full of crooked teeth and he celebrates a teammates’ basket with a few dance moves.  At the end of the game, he daps everyone up before heading to the fence gate, strapping on a backpack nearly the size of his own body. 
            </p>
            <p>At the gate, he turns around, waves goodbye, and hollers, “I’ll get you next time!”
